# gun-cg-waitingscreen
Waiting screen for Road to Rio made with gun.js, a fork from https://github.com/filiphanes/gun-overlays
Simple and powerfull remote controlled html pages useful for overlays in OBS Studio, Casper CD, XSplit or simply fullscreen browser.

## Features
- server holds overlay state
- on refresh or reconnect, state is updated from server for overlay and controller so you don't loose texts etc.
- multiple overlay-controller groups on 1 server instance (via different websocket paths)
- server is needed only for first connect, both controller and overlay holds state info

# Install
NodeJS is needed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/

    npm install

# Run
## 1. Run websocket server
Node server:

    node server.js

## 2. Open controller
Open in browser `lower-third-simple/controller.html`.

## 3. Open overlay
Open in browser `lower-third-simple/overlay.html`

# Setup in playout software
Setting you might need to change is websocket URI in `overlay.html` and `controller.html` in directory `your-overlay/`.
Set it to the same IP address and port as your server is running on, (i.e. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/gun`).

2. Select BrowserSource
3. Name the source and click "OK"
4. Check the "Local file" box
